We know many "WWinos" out there are familiar with the wwondeful [Vivino](https://www.vivino.com/) website and app. If you’re not, we highly recommend checking them out. While a Vivino account isn’t required for WW, it’s a fantastic tool that can greatly enhance your wine experience. Wonderful Wino accesses the public areas of the Vivino site to obtain the basic facts about your wine streamlining the task of adding them to your inventory.

  

Exposing your wine collection to Home Assistant's Voice Assistant (with AI) via the Local ToDo List integration opens up limitless possibilities. When properly configured, your wine facts are just a question away. *Hey Nabu... How many Cabs do I have? What is my oldest vintage? Which wine is rated the highest?* But it can be so much more than that. It is like having a personal sommelier available at your every whim. (OK, you got to open the bottle yourself!).

The ToDo list itself provides on-the-go convenience. The user can see his wine along with essential wine facts in a compact form. Also the user can perform a subset of wine inventory tasks such as informing Wonderful Wino's backend that you consumed a bottle (which removes it from inventory and permits you to optionally rate the wine you just drank).

  Most personal databases fail due to the tedium of entering data regularly. This is where Wonderful Wino really shines! Beyond the Wonderful Wino Add-on and its GUI, there are currently two additional input tools to help streamline adding wine to your inventory after a visit to your favorite wine merchant...

For those users of the Chrome Browser, there is the [Wonderful Wino Chrome Extension](https://github.com/FrankJaco/wwino-chrome-extension).
